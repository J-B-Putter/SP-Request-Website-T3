# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

I need something to help me manage a service I provide on SimplePlanes.com (taking screenshots for fellow builders' thumbnails). I keep forgetting and need something to remind me. 


## End-User Requirements

My end-user will be SimplePlanes players and users of simpleplanes.com. Their requirements are to be able to give the URL of their build to me and write a few notes on how they want their screenshots taken. They want to be able to select from a list of mods the ones they want me to use. On the home page they want to see some of my previous work. 

## Proposed Solution

My solution will be a web app where users of the simpleplanes.com community can log in, request screenshots, and set a deadline for when they want their request to be fulfilled by. When the user places a request, they will be able to attach the URL to their build, write a description of how the screenshots should be, and select the mods they want me to use. They will also be asked to pick a deadline (when they want the screenshots to be done). 
To make the work lighter on me, each user will only be allowed one request every 10 days.

# Relevant Implications

## FUNCTIONALITY

Everything works as it should and as expected. All the required functions are avilable and works properly without bugs or errors from the user's point of view. 

### Relevance to the System

Like with any project my project also needs to function well and not have any sudden unexpected errors. All the functions I integrate must meet the user's requirements and therefore be in working condition. If my project fails to do the expected task, users will no longer make use of it and it will become obsolete. 

### Impact / Considerations

I will have to pay close attention to mistakes in my code. Before I release the project to the public, thorough testing and bug fixing should be done to ensure that the user does not encounter any errors. 



## USABILITY

The end user does not get confused with what is happening on the web app and every function they want to use is easy to use and in logical places. The user can use the web app without external assistance. 

### Relevance to the System

If the user visit my site with a goal in mind (to place a request), they should be able to achieve it with ease and without confusion or frustration. Every major function should be easy to find and in a logical location. 

### Impact / Considerations

The layout of my web app should be relatively conventional and logical. Appropriate labels and symbols will be used to guide the user. The design and layout of the wabsite will place the focus on the most important functions. 



## AESTHETICS

Aesthetics refers to the visual design and layout of the website. It is pleasing for the user to look at and good colour and font comabinations are used that reflect the theme. 

### Relevance to the System

My web app is mostly aimed at players of a specific game (SimplePlanes). Following the same design as the existing website as well as the aesthetics of the game will likely appeal to the user the best. 

### Impact / Considerations

I need to use the same colour pallet as the game along with the style of the buttons to make the user feel "at home". 



## ACCESSIBILITY

Users of all abilities can access the web app on most common devices with relatively no difference in experience. 

### Relevance to the System

SimplePlanes is available on multaple platforms including Mobile devices and Desktop PCs. My website should be available on both of these platforms, giving an equal experience reqardless of the user's prefered device. The colour sceme and visual appearance of my website should not desturb users regardless of their abilities. 

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to design the layout for more than one device and pay close attension to colours, fonts, and sudden brightness changes to give all users of all abilities the same experience. 



## PRIVACY

Privacy refers to the amount of security there are to protect a users pesonal data from being stolen as well as what data is required from the user to allow the website to work. 

### Relevance to the System

Although my website will not require much personal data from the user in order to work, it will require their username from another website. To some users this might seem unsafe and therefore I will ensure them that none of their data will be stolen and I will not get access to their account on this specific website. 

### Impact / Considerations

Each user's password will be encripted before being stored in the database. Before a user registers, they will need to agree to a the website's privacy policy and terms of service.

# User Experience (UX) Principles

## USEFUL

The final product fulfils an important need for the target audience and genuinely helps them with a specific inconvenience. 

### Relevance to the System

My website should be a solution to a problem and not only an aesthetic way to achieve the goal the end-user has. This is not hard to achieve since my problem is unique to me and my target audience. 

### Impact / Considerations

My website will be useful as long as it exists.
