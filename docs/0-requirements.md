# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

I need something to help me manage a service I provide on SimplePlanes.com (taking screenshots for fellow builders' thumbnails). I keep forgetting and need something to remind me. 


## End-User Requirements

My end-user will be SimplePlanes players and users of simpleplanes.com. Their requirements are to be able to give the URL of their build to me and write a few notes on how they want their screenshots taken. They want to be able to select from a list of mods the ones they want me to use. On the home page they want to see some of my previous work. 

## Proposed Solution

My solution will be a web app where users of the simpleplanes.com community can log in, request screenshots, and set a deadline for when they want their request to be fulfilled by. When the user places a request, they will be able to attach the URL to their build, write a description of how the screenshots should be, and select the mods they want me to use. They will also be asked to pick a deadline (when they want the screenshots to be done). 
To make the work lighter on me, each user will only be allowed one request every 10 days.

# Relevant Implications

## FUNCTIONALITY

Everything works as it should and as expected. All the required functions are avilable and works properly without bugs or errors from the user's point of view. 

### Relevance to the System

Like with any project my project also needs to function well and not have any sudden unexpected errors. All the functions I integrate must meet the user's requirements and therefore be in working condition. If my project fails to do the expected task, users no longer make use of it and it will become obsolete. 

### Impact / Considerations

I will have to pay close attention to mistakes in my code. Before I release the project to the public, thorough testing and bug fixing should be done to ensure that the user does not encounter any errors.
