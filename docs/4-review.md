# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### FUNCTIONALITY

I tried to fix all the bugs and mistakes I made to ensure that the webb app fulfils the needs of the end user, preventing anything from feeling incomplete and faulty. 

### USABILITY

I tried to design the webb app to be logical and easy to use. I made the basic and most important functions clearly visible to avoid confusion. 


### AESTHETICS

In all honesty, I did not get time to work on aesthetics of any kind. The webb app still looks the same as when I started. 


### ACCESSIBILITY

My webb app is only tested on desktops. I do not know if it will work on any other device. 


### PRIVACY

The end user does have basic privacy. No user can access the account of another without knowing their password and username which is protected by encryption before stored in the data base.

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well?
    I did get most of the basic functionality done. 
- What didn't go so well?
    I did not get time to work on aesthetics and some basic functions are still faulty and incomplete. 
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
    I did not do any specific testing since the basic functionalities are still incomplete. 
- What would you do differently if you could?
    If I had the ability to work on my project after school hours, I would have used it to crate a better product.
