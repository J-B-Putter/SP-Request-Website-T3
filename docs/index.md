## Project Description

My project will be a web app where users of the SimplePlanes.com community can request screenshots from me for their builds. 
In the app, users will be able to sign in and fill out a form with details and instructions on how they want their screenshots taken, I will be able to give them the screenshots via URL, and they will be limited by the amount of requests they can place within a certain time. 
The webb app will also notify me when deadlines are appraoching as well as when a new request is placed. 

- Feature 1: Users will be able to log in to save their requests. 
- Feature 2: Users will be able to fill out a form and place a URL of the build they want screenshots taken of.
- Feature 3: When a request is placed the user will be on a cooldown timer (10 days).
- Feature 4: I will be notified when a request is placed.
- Feature 5: I will be able to respond to the request by placing notes and the URL to the screenshots.
- Feature 6: I will be notified when a dealine to a request is approaching.
